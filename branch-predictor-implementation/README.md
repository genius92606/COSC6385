# Environment
OS: Ubuntu

## Compile
1. cd src folder
2. ```make```
3. back to branch-prediction folder
4. ```run traces``` or ```csh run traces``` (might have to install csh and bc)
5. For complete function of Pentium M, please use ```run-extra traces``` or ```csh run-extra traces``` (Probably won't finished) (Yeah.. I didn't finish)
